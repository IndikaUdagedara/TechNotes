	- MCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities:
		- **Resources**: File-like data that can be read by clients (like API responses or file contents)
		- **Tools**: Functions that can be called by the LLM (with user approval)
		- **Prompts**: Pre-written templates that help users accomplish specific tasks
	- What happens when a user sends prompts to a Client (e.g., Claude Desktop)
		- The client sends your question to Claude
		- Claude analyzes the available tools and decides which one(s) to use
		- The client executes the chosen tool(s) through the MCP server
		- The results are sent back to Claude
		- Claude formulates a natural language response
		- The response is displayed to you!

			- Edge node can be a VM or a dedicated bare-metal server. It provides **network services**Â like routing, NAT, VPN, and load balancing.
			- ## Summary
				- **ESXi Host**
					- A physical server running VMs.
					- Has two network connections (Uplink1 and Uplink2) to the outside world.
				- **Virtual Switch (VDS)**
					- Like a power strip for network connectionsâ€”connects VMs to the network.
				- **NSX Edge VM**
					- A special VM that acts like a router or firewall.
					- Helps VMs talk to the outside world and between different networks.
				- **TEP (Tunnel Endpoint)**
					- A virtual network port used to send traffic between hosts securely.
				- ### ðŸ”„ Â  **Two Types of Network Paths**
				- **Uplink VLAN Path (Red Line)**
					- Used for traffic going in/out of the data center (north-south).
					- Connects the Edge VM to the physical network.
				- **Overlay Path (Blue Line)**
					- Used for traffic between VMs across different hosts (east-west).
					- Uses tunnels to send data over the physical network.
			- ## Details
				- ### ðŸ”§ Â  **Key Components**
				- **Uplink1 & Uplink2**
					- These are physical NICs (pNICs) on the ESXi host.
					- They connect the host to the physical network infrastructure.
					- Each uplink is associated with aÂ **trunk segment**, allowing multiple VLANs to traverse the same physical link.
				- **Trunk1 Segment & Trunk2 Segment**
					- These are logical network segments that carry VLAN-tagged traffic.
					- They are used to connect theÂ **NSX Edge VM**Â to the physical network via theÂ **Uplink VLAN Path**.
				- **Virtual Distributed Switch (VDS)**
					- A VMware vSphere component that provides centralized management of virtual network configurations across multiple hosts.
					- It connects VMs (like the Edge VM) to the physical network through the uplinks.
				- **Edge VM**
					- A virtual appliance that provides routing, NAT, VPN, and other network services in NSX-T.
					- It has two interfaces:
						- **FP0**: Connected to the physical network via theÂ **Uplink VLAN Path**Â (red dashed line).
						- **FP1**: Connected to the NSX-T overlay network via theÂ **Overlay Path**Â (blue dashed line).
				- **NSX Gateway**
					- Represents the logical router or gateway functionality provided by the Edge VM.
					- It connects the overlay network to the external physical network.
				- **TEP (Tunnel Endpoint)**
					- Used for encapsulating and decapsulating overlay traffic (Geneve protocol).
					- Facilitates communication between NSX-T transport nodes over theÂ **Overlay Path**.
					  
					  ---
				- ### ðŸ”„ Â  **Traffic Paths**
				- **Uplink VLAN Path (Red Dashed Line)**
					- Connects the Edge VMâ€™s FP0 interface to the physical network via VLAN trunking.
					- Used for north-south traffic (external communication).
				- **Overlay Path (Blue Dashed Line)**
					- Connects the Edge VMâ€™s FP1 interface to the NSX-T overlay network.
					- Used for east-west traffic (VM-to-VM within the NSX domain).
